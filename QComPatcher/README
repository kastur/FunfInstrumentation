The scripts in this directory aid in patching an Android device
with the Override framework.

You can only patch the framework if the phone is rooted!

STEPS
1. Change directory to FrameworkPatcher, and then setup the PATH.
   $ source scripts/envsetup.sh

   JRO03C version of Jellybean.

   You can use the following to pull your version of framework.jar
   This will place framework.jar in the FrameworkPatcher directory.
   $ pull_framework

   MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A BACKUP of the original framework.jar!
   This can come in handy if the phone does not boot with the
   patched framework.jar!

3. Make sure the OverrideFramework is built. The script will
   look for a OverrideSerivce.apk file in ../out

4. $ run_from_scratch
   This will decompile the framework.jar and OverrideService.apk
   and do the necessary surgery to patch a new framework.jar that
   contains the OverrideLocationManager as a system service.

5. $ push_framework
   Pushes the new framework back onto the Android device.
   Also clears the dalvik cache.

6. $ adb reboot
   Reboot the device for the new framework to take effect.
   You should see a "Android Upgrading" screen on next bootup.
